## Team


The Quantitative and Computational Social Science (QCSS) lab is a research group led by a Professor of Sociology and composed primarily of PhD students in Sociology. The lab's research focus is on developing and applying quantitative and computational methods to study social phenomena, with a particular emphasis on issues related to inequality, social networks, and political behavior.

The lab members use a variety of tools and techniques from statistics, machine learning, and network analysis to analyze large-scale datasets and identify patterns and trends in social behavior. They also develop new methods and models for understanding social phenomena and testing theories about the causes and consequences of social inequality.

The QCSS lab's research projects cover a wide range of topics, such as the effects of social media on political polarization, the impact of economic inequality on health outcomes, and the dynamics of social networks and their effects on individual behavior. The lab's interdisciplinary approach draws on expertise from sociology, computer science, statistics, and other fields to tackle complex social problems and answer pressing social questions.

In addition to conducting research, the QCSS lab is committed to training the next generation of social scientists in quantitative and computational methods. The lab provides opportunities for PhD students to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools and techniques, and to collaborate on research projects with other members of the lab and with scholars from other institutions. The lab also offers workshops and training sessions to help students and scholars learn and apply quantitative and computational methods in their own research.
