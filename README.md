## Team


The Quantitative and Computational Social Science Research Group focuses on developing and applying quantitative and computational methods to study a wide range of social phenomena, with a particular emphasis on issues related to inequality, social networks, and political behavior. While the lab is based in the Sociology Department a the UC Chile the research here developed draws on expertise from other fields, such as economics, political science, computer science, and statistics.

In addition to conducting research, the $\text{qCS}^2$ lab is committed to training the next generation of social scientists. The lab provides opportunities for graduate students to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools and techniques, and to collaborate on research projects with other members of the lab. The lab also offers workshops and training sessions to help students and scholars learn and apply quantitative and computational methods in their own research.
